===================

Regarding your question — why journal entries appear in the Purchase account:

When you update the cost price of a product that has stock on hand, Odoo automatically adjusts the value of your inventory to reflect the new cost. This triggers balancing journal entries to ensure your accounts remain accurate.

But the difference in inventory value must be recorded somewhere:
    It can’t go to the vendor because no new purchase is made.
    It can’t be left unbalanced, as accounting entries must always match.
So, where does the difference go?
    -> It goes to the Expense Account, typically configured as Purchase or Price Difference, depending on your product category settings.

The journal entries appear in the Purchase account because this account is set as the Expense Account in the product category configuration.

•   If the cost increases (e.g., ₹50 → ₹100):
    - Inventory value increases by ₹50
    - A ₹50 credit is posted to the Purchase account
•   If the cost decreases (e.g., ₹100 → ₹50):
    - Inventory value decreases by ₹50
    - A ₹50 debit is posted to the Purchase account

These entries ensure your inventory value on the Balance Sheet is accurate, and your Profit & Loss account reflects the impact of cost changes.

========================
=======================
When you manually change the cost price , the value of stock on hand changes.

Odoo needs to adjust the value of your inventory accordingly. 
That difference in value must go somewhere:
    It can't go to the vendor (you're not buying more stock).
    It can't stay unbalanced (accounting must always balance).
So, where does it go?
    It goes to an Expense or Price Difference account.
=============

When the cost price of a product is changed in Odoo, and the product's category is configured with the following account:
Expense Account: 600001 Purchase
The system automatically creates related journal entries to reflect the updated value of the existing stock.

If the product already has stock on hand, Odoo adjusts the inventory valuation to match the new cost. 
This change impacts the accounting records to ensure the Balance Sheet remains accurate.

Example:
If the product’s cost is updated from ₹50 to ₹100, Odoo:
    Increases the Inventory (Stock Valuation) account by ₹50 (the difference).
    Records a credit entry of ₹50 to the ‘Purchase’ account  
    — this is not a new purchase, but an adjustment to balance the accounting entry due to the cost change.

This ensures that the stock value in inventory and the accounting balance stay correct and aligned.

Clint Replay is --
In this valuation change there is no outside liability arising its only for the in house purpose, so you have to either use any corresponding ledger in inventory like stock inward/outward or any other expense accounts other than purchase account like stock revaluation account.
By this entry, we are not able to differentiate actual purchase and stock differences

Now what i whoud you say to clint
