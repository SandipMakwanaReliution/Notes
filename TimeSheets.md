   - Resolved by removing blank MOs and correcting the delivery by removing the wrong kit product.
   - Identified another issue where validating a delivery that time automatically created an invoice, but curtain products were missing.
   - Determined that this issue was caused by the same reason: the wrong kit BOM being selected when validating a delivery, which also prevented the delivered quantity from being added to the Sales Order. This issue was resolved by manager.

🔍 R&D: Fix Issue
   2:00
   - Debugged Odoo’s account move and stock valuation record preparation methods.
   - Found the issue: when the PO product price and the product’s standard price did not match, the system failed to validate the return picking.
   - Discussed with manager and tested the same operation in other projects to compare behavior.
   2:00
   - Verified that other projects did not face the problem, confirming no issues in stock valuation or account move preparation.
   - Identified custom code specific to this project that was not present in others.
   - Modified the custom condition for fetching stock valuation records to resolve the issue.

🔍 R&D: Daily Report Issue
   3:00
   - Investigated why a Salesperson ID key error appeared when printing the Daily Report.
   - Found that the report functionality fetched product type using the Sale ID in invoices and credit notes.
   - When invoices/credit notes were created manually, no Sale ID was set, caused the error.
   - Resolved by fetching product type directly using Product ID instead of Sale ID.
   2:20
   - Faced another issue: when invoices/credit notes used Service products, no custom product type was set.
   - Fixed this by grouping all undefined product types under “Other”.
   - Updated the report view accordingly and applied the same fix across all projects.
