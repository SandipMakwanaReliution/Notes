- Values: (0, 0, { fields }) create
- (1, ID, { fields }) update (write fields to ID)
- (2, ID) remove (calls unlink on ID, that will also delete the relationship because of the ondelete)
- (3, ID) unlink (delete the relationship between the two objects but does not delete ID)
- (4, ID) link (add a relationship)
- (5, ID) unlink all
- (6, ?, ids) set a list of links
